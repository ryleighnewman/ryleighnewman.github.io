            <h2 class="section-title-blue">some fun facts to know me better</h2>
            <p>I am a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do.</p>
            <p>I have lived in thirteen different houses.</p>
            <p>My birthdate is July 2, 2004. I am twenty years old.</p>
            <p>I love researching new technology and making my own ideas/prototypes.</p>
            <p>My family currently has four dogs, five goats, five horses, two cats, and a bird!</p>
            <p>I have been wearing leg braces since I was eight years old and am now in a wheelchair.</p>
            <p>I saved my mom’s life when I was four years old by spotting skin cancer patterns on her back, which helped ignite my love towards helping others.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title-blue">my life story</h2>
            <p>I was diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss shortly after birth. The loss is mild/moderate in my left ear, and severe/profound in my right ear.</p>
            <p>At seven years old, I was diagnosed with an unknown neuromuscular disease that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT. This disease causes slow deterioration of the myelin sheath in my limbs, permanently damaging nerves.</p>
            <p>To deal with these two conditions, I wear hearing aids in both ears, and I'm now in a wheelchair.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title-blue">volunteer experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Muscular Dystrophy Association State Ambassador of Florida: 2017 – 2019</strong></p>
            <p>As the state ambassador of Florida, I volunteered over four-hundred hours into raising money for neuromuscular disease research and patient care. I had the opportunity to give speeches at public and private events and be involved with my community to share my personal story and spread awareness. I am so grateful to say that I raised over $120,000 for the MDA! This money will fund research and patient care.</p>
            <p>To this day, I continue to spread awareness about rare neuromuscular diseases and share my story.</p>
