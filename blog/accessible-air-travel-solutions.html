                <p>
                    I recently returned home to Palm Beach International Airport after traveling to Washington, D.C. to compete in National Model United Nations.
                    The trip itself was meaningful and exciting, but the most stressful part had nothing to do with the competition.
                    <span style="color: rgb(100, 150, 200); font-weight: 600;">
                        It was something most people never have to think about: flying with a wheelchair.
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This was not my first time traveling with a wheelchair, but it was the first time flying with a new chair.
                    My previous wheelchair was destroyed during air travel with Air France, an experience that permanently changed how I approach flying.
                    Since then, every flight carries an underlying fear that my independence may not arrive intact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Flying is scary when your mobility depends on equipment you are forced to hand over.
                    While most passengers feel relief as the plane descends, wheelchair users brace themselves.
                    The excitement of landing is replaced by anxiety about what will be waiting at the gate.
                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <h2 class="section-title-blue">The Reality of Damage</h2>

                <p>
                    After landing, I was transferred off the aircraft using an aisle chair.
                    I was pulled backwards off the plane, as is standard procedure.
                    When I turned around, I instinctively looked to confirm that my wheelchair was still in one piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time, it was not.
                    The joystick and mounting bracket were snapped completely in half.
                    This was not cosmetic damage. The joystick is the primary interface that allows me to move independently.
                </p>

                <figure class="blog-figure">
                    <img
                        src="/assets/images/blog/accessible-air-travel-solutions/broken-joystick-closeup.png"
                        alt="Close-up of a wheelchair joystick snapped in half after air travel."
                        class="hero-headshot hero-headshot-2"
                    />
                    <figcaption class="blog-caption">
                        The wheelchair joystick and mounting bracket snapped during handling after the flight.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    I noticed the damage immediately, before I had even fully exited the aircraft.
                    I taped the broken components together and balanced them on my cupholder just to make it out of the airport.
                    I was fortunate to be able to attempt a temporary fix on the spot. Many wheelchair users are not.
                </p>

                <ul class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>American Airlines replaced the damaged parts at a cost of approximately $700.</li>
                    <li>Heavier rehabilitation chairs are almost always forced into cargo storage, increasing the risk of severe damage.</li>
                    <li>A broken chair means the immediate loss of mobility, safety, and independence.</li>
                    <li>For custom devices, repairs can reach tens of thousands of dollars.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These outcomes are not rare or unpredictable.
                    They are the direct result of systems that treat mobility devices as baggage rather than as essential extensions of a person’s body.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title-blue">Low-Cost, High-Impact Solutions</h2>

                <p>
                    Accessibility is often framed as expensive or impractical.
                    In reality, airlines already absorb the cost of damaged wheelchairs.
                    Preventing that damage is both economically sensible and ethically necessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style="color: rgb(100,150,200); font-weight: 700;">1.</span>
                    <strong>Protective Wheelchair Crates</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Airlines already use protective containers for specialized equipment such as musical instruments.
                    Standardized, rigid, reusable crates for wheelchairs would prevent catastrophic damage during loading and unloading
                    and reduce costly repair claims over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style="color: rgb(100,150,200); font-weight: 700;">2.</span>
                    <strong>Basic Crew Training and Loading Protocols</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I ask whether my chair can remain in the cabin, responses range from confusion to polite refusal.
                    Sometimes staff are motivated to help. Sometimes there is no effort at all.
                    Short, mandatory training would give crews the confidence and knowledge to handle wheelchairs correctly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style="color: rgb(100,150,200); font-weight: 700;">3.</span>
                    <strong>Mandatory Pre-Flight Inspection Photos</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple photo documentation at the gate would create accountability for both airlines and passengers.
                    This step would reduce disputes over when damage occurred and streamline the claims process without requiring new infrastructure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style="color: rgb(100,150,200); font-weight: 700;">4.</span>
                    <strong>Treat Mobility as Essential Equipment</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A wheelchair is not luggage.
                    It is an extension of the body.
                    Until airline policies reflect that reality, air travel will remain inaccessible for millions of people.
                </p>
